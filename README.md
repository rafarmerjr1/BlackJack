# BlackJack

Next items to do:

- Stateful so that it can be run by multiple users/browsers at once
- Hosting
- Debouncing on user input so API is not called with each character
    - Fixed by using 'gameStarted' state and no longer calling getBalance on render

CSS mostly modified from here: https://github.com/rajshekhar26/cleanfolio-minimal
